 * processes that have already terminated by the time the parent calls
 * wait, but the kernel must still allow the parent to retrieve its childâ€™s
 * exit status, or learn that the child was terminated by the kernel.

 * -pid does not refer to a direct child of the calling process. pid is a
 * direct child of the calling process if and only if the calling process
 * received pid as a return value from a successful call to exec. Note
 * that children are not inherited: if A spawns child B and B spawns child
 * process C, then A cannot wait for C, even if B is dead. A call to
 * wait(C) by process A must fail. Similarly, orphaned processes are not
 * assigned to a new parent if their parent process exits before they do.
 * The process that calls wait has already called wait on pid. That is, a
 * process may wait for any given child at most once.
 * Processes may spawn any number of children, wait for them in any order,
 * and may even exit without having waited for some or all of their
 * children. Your design should consider all the ways in which waits can
 * occur. All of a process's resources, including its struct thread, must
 * be freed whether its parent ever waits for it or not, and regardless of
 * whether the child exits before or after its parent.
 * You must ensure that Pintos does not terminate until the initial
 * process exits. The supplied Pintos code tries to do this by calling
 * process_wait() (in userprog/process.c) from main() (in threads/init.c).
 * We suggest that you implement process_wait() according to the comment
